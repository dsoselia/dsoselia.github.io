Hi,
======

I am Davit, a graduate student at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/) as of Fall 2022. I have a passion for solving problems with ML and also enjoy better understanding what makes ML models tick and how we could improve them. Hoping that this step of my journey will help me progress in both of these areas.

I enjoy all areas of ML, but if I were to rank them, the top would be CV, then NLP, and then Recommender Systems. I am also interested in the intersection of ML and other fields such as medical imaging, code generation, and security.

What's New?
======

- 2022-09-05: Moved to College Park, MD to pursue studies in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. Really excited to get a chance to be back in an academic setting and delve deeper into some of the topics I've been interested in for a while now. I'm also looking forward to the opportunities that come with being in a new city and meeting new people.

  This comes at the 3 year anneversary of arriving in Sweden, I am very grateful for the time I've had here and for the amazing people I've met, worked, and studied with.

  Some of the highlights from my time in Sweden include:

  - Working as a research engineer as part at RPL under Prof. Hossein Azizpour, focusing on DL research has been really exciting for me and something I hope to continue doing in the future.

  - Trying to better approximate human movement with ML at Movability lab at KTH under prof. Elena Gutierrez Farewik.

  - Google TVC assignment, working on some really cool stuff, that unfortunately I can talk little about.

  - FinSentim - Deep Learning for Financial Sentiment Analysis, developed togehter with my friends and collegues.

  - Working on Chromosome and genetic data analysis using ML together with amazing team at Arkus AI.

- 2021-08-21: Completed my thesis on 'Continual Learning and Biomedical Image Data' at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. Really grateful to my supervisor Saikat Chatterjee for all the support and guidance throughout the thesis. Working on datasets of this size (4TB+ of data) was a first for me and proved an interesting challenge.
