> ðŸ“¢ **Note:** Are you an Engineer, Researcher, or Entrepreneur looking for feedback on your project? I'm here to help. I love to play around with new libraries, gadgets, models, and APIs and happy to provide honest and constructive feedback. Feel free to ping me at dsoselia@umd.edu. Excited to see what you're working on!

Hi there! My name is Davit and I am a graduate student at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/) as of Fall 2022. I have a passion for solving problems with machine learning and am always looking for ways to better understand how models work and how we can improve them. I am excited to embark on this new journey and hope that it will help me progress in both of these areas.

I enjoy all areas of machine learning, but my particular interests include computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. I am also interested in exploring the intersection of machine learning with other fields such as medical imaging, code generation, and security.

In my professional experience, I have worked as a machine learning engineer and software engineer, and have completed internships in research. I have led projects in machine learning and software development, and have worked with clients in Georgia and the EU. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and robotics, and I have published papers in journals and presented at conferences and workshops.

Thank you for visiting my personal web page. I hope you find the information here helpful. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via my contact information. I am always happy to chat with other tech enthusiasts and share ideas and experiences.


What's New?
======

- 2022-09-05: I moved to College Park, MD to begin studying Computer Science at the University of Maryland. I am excited to return to an academic setting and have the opportunity to dive deeper into topics that I have been interested in for a while. I'm also looking forward to exploring a new city and meeting new people.This move marks the three-year anniversary of my arrival in Sweden, and I am grateful for the time I have had here and the amazing people I have met, worked with, and studied with. Some of the highlights of my time in Sweden include:

  - Working as a research engineer at RPL under Professor Hossein Azizpour, where I had the opportunity to focus on exciting deep learning research that I hope to continue in the future.

  - Collaborating with Professor Elena Gutierrez Farewik at the Movability Lab at KTH to try to better approximate human movement with machine learning.
 
  - Google TVC assignment, working on some really cool stuff, that unfortunately I can talk little about.

  - Developing FinSentim, a tool for deep learning-based financial sentiment analysis, with my friends and colleagues.

  - Working on Chromosome and genetic data analysis using ML together with amazing team at Arkus AI.

- 2021-08-21: I am thrilled to have completed my thesis on 'Continual Learning and Biomedical Image Data' at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. I am so grateful to my supervisor Saikat Chatterjee for all of their support and guidance throughout the process. Working with datasets of this size (4TB+ of data) was a new experience for me and proved to be an interesting challenge. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work on this project and am excited to see where it takes me in the future.
