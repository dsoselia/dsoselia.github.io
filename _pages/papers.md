- We developed a framework for recognizing handwritten Georgian text using self-normalizing convolutional neural networks (CNN). We created an extensive dataset with over 200,000 character samples to train the CNN model, and then made the framework available to users in the form of a web service and apps for various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and iOS.
